<font size = 4><b>For future RIS-assisted communication systems, explore how to deal with emerging challenges such as the wideband effect, spatial non-stationary effect. In addition, for specific characteristics of RIS, such as the "multiplicative fading" effect, design algorithms based on the idea of channel coding.</b></font>
