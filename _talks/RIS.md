<font size = 4><b>For future RIS-assisted communication systems, explore how to deal with emerging challenges such as the wideband effect, spatial non-stationary effect. In addition, for specific characteristics of RIS, such as the "multiplicative fading" effect, design algorithms based on the idea of channel coding.</b></font>

## [Coded Beam Training for RIS-Assisted Communication Systems](https://hericenes.github.io/yuhaochen.github.io/research/RIS/CBT-RIS)

<font size = 4><b>Propose a beam training framework in RIS systems based on the idea of channel coding to enhance the beam training accuracy. Apply the 4-ary code in the design of the framework.</b></font>

## [Accurate & Effective Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale RIS](https://hericenes.github.io/yuhaochen.github.io/research/RIS/Accurate)

<font size = 4><b>Extend the GTBC to the RIS scenario to deal with the spatial non-stationarity. Design a dynamic codebook to represent the cascaded near-field channel in RIS systems effectively.</b></font>

## [Analytical Beam Training Framework for RIS-Assisted Wideband THz Systems](https://hericenes.github.io/yuhaochen.github.io/research/RIS/analytical)

<font size = 4><b>Analyze the specific power distribution pattern of the wideband effect in RIS-assisted wideband THz systems. Design a beam training framework by exploiting this effect rather than overcoming it.</b></font>
