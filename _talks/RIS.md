<font size = 4><b>For future RIS-assisted communication systems, explore how to deal with emerging challenges such as the wideband effect, spatial non-stationary effect. In addition, for specific characteristics of RIS, such as the "multiplicative fading" effect, design algorithms based on the idea of channel coding.</b></font>

## [Coded Beam Training for RIS-Assisted Communication Systems](https://hericenes.github.io/yuhaochen.github.io/research/RIS/CBT-RIS)

<font size = 4><b>Design a beam training framework in RIS systems based on the idea of channel coding to enhance the beam training accuracy. Propose a novel codeword design scheme and an encoder design scheme based on the hardware constraints of RIS.</b></font>

## [Accurate & Effective Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale RIS](https://hericenes.github.io/yuhaochen.github.io/research/RIS/Accurate)

<font size = 4><b>Propose a group time block code (GTBC) based RIS decoupling scheme to deal with the spatial non-stationarity in RIS systems. Design a dynamic codebook to represent the cascaded near-field channel in RIS systems effectively.</b></font>
