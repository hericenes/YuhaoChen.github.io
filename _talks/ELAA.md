<font size = 4><b>For future ELAA systems, explore accurate & effective CSI acquisitions algorithms in the presence of several new electromagnetic phenomena such as spatial non-stationary effect and near-field effect. In addition, the properties of ELAA with different geometric structures are investigated and exploited.</b></font>
